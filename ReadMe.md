This is an old Project. I decided to put at GitHub some old code I have found saved in old CDs. 

The parts that may be of interest to you, maybe:

Working with threads. The internal representation of the Windows File system, as it was at least until Windows 7 SDK.

In folderSplitter.cpp 

CopyMoveDir it is method that use a stack to make the recursive traversing of dirs, while copying to destination folder.


Old Readme:

Folder Spliter (Free release)

Folder Splitter is a tool for splitting big folder trees in smaller folders so they can be saved on CDs, or any other media, and later the origin folder maybe constructed by copying the folders back again, and the folder tree is reconstructed without need of this tool.

History

I came with the idea of creating a folder splitter tool, it was made as a C# .Net Windows Application, for splitting big folders I needed to burn on CDs in my current job. But I wanted to make, for myself, a C++ version. Then I came with the idea to create a complete set of file manager program and tools which I am working on.

This realese is to test for some distribution mechanisms I have found in the web. And to luckly get in touch with potential users, and with their feedback, contribution and help, I hope we can make this project grow faster and more useful.

My plans is to keep it as free as possible, but also I want to have a modest income. So, contribute if you can.

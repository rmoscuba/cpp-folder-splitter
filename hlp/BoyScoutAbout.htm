		<P>Boy Scout&nbsp;is a&nbsp;file manager program and&nbsp;tools and interfaces 
			currently on development stage. The current&nbsp;tool must be considered as a 
			beta release, we will be very glad if you please to give us any feedback or 
			report any bug. You can also ask for any particular tool you may need, and we 
			will make the best to add it to this project. (See bottom for contact details)</P>
		<P><STRONG>Folder Spliter (Free release)</STRONG></P>
		<P>Folder Splitter is a tool for splitting big folder trees in smaller folders so 
			they can be saved on CDs, or any other media, and later the origin folder maybe 
			constructed by copying the folders back again, and the folder tree is 
			reconstructed without need of this tool.</P>

		<P><STRONG>History</STRONG></P>
		<P>I came with the idea of creating a folder splitter tool, it 
			was&nbsp;made&nbsp;as a C# .Net Windows Application, for splitting big folders 
			I needed to burn on CDs in my current job.&nbsp;But I wanted to make, for 
			myself, a C++ version. Then I came with the idea to create a complete set of 
			file manager program and tools which I am working on.</P>
		<P>This realese is to test for some distribution mechanisms I have found in the 
			web. And to luckly get in touch with potential users, and with their feedback, 
			contribution and help, I hope we can make this project grow faster and more 
			useful.</P>
		<P>My plans is to keep it as free as possible, but also I want to have a modest 
			income. So, contribute if you can.
